In this paper, we explore noise injection before computing a gradient step, which is known to have smoothing and regularizing properties. We show that small perturbations induce explicit regularization for simple finite-dimensional models based on the l1-norm, group l1-norms, or nuclear norms. When applied to overparametrized neural networks with large widths, we show that the same perturbations do not work due to variance explosion resulting from overparametrization. However, we also show that independent layer wise perturbations allow to avoid the exploding variance term, and explicit regularizers can then be obtained. We empirically show that the small perturbations lead to better generalization performance than vanilla (stochastic) gradient descent training, with minor adjustments to the training procedure.","tags":["optimization","generalization","noise injection"],"title":"Explicit Regularization in Overparametrized Models via Noise Injection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hans Kersting"],"categories":["General"],"content":"This new paper is a follow-up to our Anti-PGD paper (ICML 2022).

Usually, uncorrelated noise is used in such perturbed gradient descent (PGD) methods. It is, however, not known if this is optimal or whether other types of noise could provide better generalization performance. In this paper, we zoom in on the problem of correlating the perturbations of consecutive PGD steps. We consider a variety of objective functions for which we find that GD with anticorrelated perturbations (\"Anti-PGD\") generalizes significantly better than GD and standard (uncorrelated) PGD. To support these experimental findings, we also derive a theoretical analysis that demonstrates that Anti-PGD moves to wider minima, while GD and PGD remain stuck in suboptimal regions or even diverge. This new connection between anticorrelated noise and generalization opens the field to novel ways to exploit noise for training machine learning models.","tags":["optimization","generalization","noise injection"],"title":"Anticorrelated Noise Injection for Improved Generalization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hans Kersting"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635257700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635257700,"objectID":"291fb8b15b9e9f6aec5dc757ace1659b","permalink":"https://hanskersting.github.io/talk/ode-filters-forward-and-backward/","publishdate":"2022-03-23T14:28:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ode-filters-forward-and-backward/","section":"event","summary":"ODE filters and smoothers are well-established probabilistic numerical methods that solve initial value problems in linear time.

In an analogous manner, we construct a Bayesian probabilistic-numerical method for ODEs. To this end, we construct a probabilistic state space model for ODEs which enables us to borrow the machinery of Bayesian filtering. This unlocks the application of all Bayesian filters from signal processing to ODEs, which we name ODE filters. We theoretically analyse the convergence rates of the most elementary one, the Kalman ODE filter and discuss its uncertainty quantification.

As the solution of many important ODEs are periodic functions (oscillators), we raise the question whether Fourier expansions can also be brought to bear within the framework of Gaussian ODE filtering.

The ODE filter proposed in recent work models the solution of the ODE by a Gauss-Markov process which serves as a prior in the sense of Bayesian statistics. While previous work employed a Wiener process prior on the (possibly multiple times) differentiated solution of the ODE and established equivalence of the corresponding solver with classical numerical methods, this paper raises the question whether other priors also yield practically useful solvers. To this end, we discuss a range of possible priors which enable fast filtering and propose a new prior---the Integrated Ornstein Uhlenbeck Process (IOUP)---that complements the existing Integrated Wiener process (IWP) filter by encoding the property that a derivative in time of the solution is bounded in the sense that it tends to drift back to zero. We provide experiments comparing IWP and IOUP filters which support the belief that IWP approximates better divergent ODE's solutions whereas IOUP is a better prior for trajectories with bounded derivatives.","tags":["Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process","ODE filters","model selection"],"title":"Bayesian Filtering for ODEs with Bounded Derivatives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hans Kersting","Philipp Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1464739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464739200,"objectID":"0487bb4ede0051e00e98724e00514b36","permalink":"https://hanskersting.github.io/publication/active-uncertainty-calibration/","publishdate":"2022-03-22T16:55:48Z","relpermalink":"/publication/active-uncertainty-calibration/","section":"publication","summary":"There is resurging interest, in statistics and machine learning, in solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that return probability measures instead of point estimates. Recently, Conrad et al. introduced a sampling-based class of methods that are 'well-calibrated' in a specific sense. But the computational cost of these methods is significantly above that of classic methods. On the other hand, Schober et al. pointed out a precise connection between classic Runge--Kutta ODE solvers and Gaussian filters, which gives only a rough probabilistic calibration, but at negligible cost overhead. By formulating the solution of ODEs as approximate inference in linear Gaussian SDEs, we investigate a range of probabilistic ODE solvers, that bridge the trade-off between computational cost and probabilistic calibration, and identify the inaccurate gradient measurement as a crucial source of uncertainty. We propose the novel filtering-based method Bayesian Quadrature filtering (BQF) which uses Bayesian quadrature to actively learn the imprecision in the gradient measurement by collecting multiple gradient evaluations.","tags":["calibration","ODE filters","Bayesian quadrature"],"title":"Active Uncertainty Calibration in Bayesian ODE Solvers","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://hanskersting.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
